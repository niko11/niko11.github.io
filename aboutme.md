I have a Bachelor degree in eCommerce. I have been working in IT for 7 years, both independently and within the Federal Government.

Beyond work, I constantly listen to music and love learning new things and learning about new start-ups, tech ideas and anything cool really. I have an obsession with Dragons Den and am a **huge** fan of the Ottawa Senators.
